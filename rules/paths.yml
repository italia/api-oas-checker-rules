      You must define a `/status` path that can be used to health-check the API.
      Using this path avoids the arbitrary usage of a server URL for health-check
      scope.

      The `/status` endpoint should return a `application/problem+json` response
      containing a successful status code if the service is working correctly.

      The service provider is free to define the implementation logic for this path.

      When you design a REST API, you don't usually need to mention terms like
      `get`, `delete` and so on in your `paths`, because this information is
      conveyed by the HTTP method.

      Instead of using

      ```
      POST /books/1234/delete HTTP/1.1
      Host: api.example
      ```

      You can simply call

      ```
      DELETE /books/1234 HTTP/1.1
      Host: api.example
      ```

      Similarly you don't need verbs like `list` or `create` because
      the HTTP Semantics RFC7231 supports this kind of actions natively
      with proper methods and status code.

      Instead of

      ```
      POST /create/user HTTP/1.1
      Host: api.example
      Content-Type: application/json

      {"given_name": "Mario"}
      ```

      You can use
      ```
      POST /create/user HTTP/1.1
      Host: api.example
      Content-Type: application/json

      {"given_name": "Mario"}
      ```

      returning a proper response

      ```
      HTTP/1.1 201 Created
      Location: /users/1234

      ```

      This simplifies securing your API as you know beforehand the kind of action
      which is going to be performed.
    message: '[RFC7231] Path "{{property}}" contains an HTTP method or action verb (e.g., get, list, create); use proper HTTP methods instead.'
